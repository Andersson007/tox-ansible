* FINISH FILTERING:
  Currently filtering is implemented inside of the Options object, but it mightb
be smart to implement that in its own world. Then we can readily add new types
of tests if we need to. Currently there should be at least the ability to filter
by role name, scenario name, and Molecule driver type.

* MORE TESTS
  Currently there are no tests that test out the full functionality of the
plugin by running an actual tox execution. Only unittests at the moment, no
integration tests. We should implement a few basic integration tests so that
we are sure things aren't going too crazy under the hood

* AUTOMATED RELEASE
  CI is in place. Time to get CD going
