* MORE TESTS
  Currently there are no tests that test out the full functionality of the
plugin by running an actual tox execution. Only unittests at the moment, no
integration tests. We should implement a few basic integration tests so that
we are sure things aren't going too crazy under the hood

* AUTOMATED RELEASE
  CI is in place. Time to get CD going
